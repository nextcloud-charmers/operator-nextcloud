# Nextcloud
The self-hosted productivity platform that keeps you in control of your data.

Works with postgresql as a database backend.

## Description
The full documentation for this charm lives here: https://charmhub.io/nextcloud/docs

## Small scale deployment
For a quick test of nextcloud, you can use this:

    juju add-model my-nextcloud
    juju model-config default-series=jammy
    juju deploy postgresql
    juju deploy nextcloud
    juju relate nextcloud:database postgresql

    ... wait for deployment to settle.
    Then, visit http://ip.ip.ip.ip

To get the admin password:

    juju run-action nextcloud/0 get-admin-password --wait

Make sure to note it and change it after first login, since this action will only work once.

## Large scale deployment
For a full scale out deployment with support for shared storage, redis and SSL deployment, see: https://charmhub.io/nextcloud/docs
